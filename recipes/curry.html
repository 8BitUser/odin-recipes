    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This is my very special curry recipe, handed down to me from my grandmother. I grew up in the British Virgin Islands in
    the Caribbean, and have eaten a lot of curry in my life, in every form you can imagine! This particular dish consists of
    a yellow curry sauce (a little bit spicy), with chicken and potatoes which is served over jasmine rice. You can also use
    it as filling inside of a roti skin (minus the rice)..</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ½ cups water, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 cups uncooked jasmine rice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cubed</li>
        <li>4 medium russet potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 (13.5 ounce) can coconut milk</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons yellow curry powder, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons white sugar, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring 3 1/2 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Stir in rice, cover, and reduce heat to low. Simmer until all of
        the water has been absorbed, about 15 minutes. Taste the rice; if it is still too firm, add a few more tablespoons of
        water. Remove from the heat, cover, and set aside.</li>
        <li>While the rice is cooking, heat oil in a large wok over medium-high heat. Add chicken, potatoes, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1
        teaspoon pepper; cook and stir until chicken is firm and no longer translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in coconut milk. Add garlic, 4 tablespoons curry powder, soy sauce, 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar, garlic powder, cumin,
        ginger, and red pepper flakes; stir with a wooden spoon until well mixed. Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low,
        and simmer until potatoes are very soft and curry aroma is strong, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Uncover the curry and turn off heat. Taste and adjust curry powder, sugar, salt, and pepper as needed. Let sit for 5
        minutes before serving over the cooked rice.</li>
