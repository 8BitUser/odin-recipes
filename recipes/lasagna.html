    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy
    filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of
    small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty
    garlic bread.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Meat:</strong> 1/2 pound of ground beef.</li>
            <li><strong>Onion:</strong> A diced onion.</li>
            <li><strong>Canned Tomatoes</strong> A can of tomato sauce.</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh herbs:</strong> Parsley and a clove of garlic.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> A dash of sugar.</li>
            <li><strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong> Dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Pasta:</strong> Uncooked Lasagna noodles.</li>
            <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> Cottage cheese, parmesan, and some shredded mozzarella</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> 2 eggs for extra layer of creaminess.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5
            to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat
            to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling
            water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until
            combined.</li>
            <li>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place
            two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2
            of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella.
            Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more
            minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
        </ol>
